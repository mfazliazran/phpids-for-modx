The module and the plugin are developed for MODx (http://WWW.modxcms.com)

This package contains the following free packages:

jQuery (http//:www.jquery.com)
jqGrid (http://www.trirand.net/)
PHPIDS (http://phpids.org/)

Without their work, my work would not been possible.



Installation:

Upload the folders lib and modules in the assets directory of your existing MODx installation with a FTP client program.
Change the access rights of  assets/lib/phpids/lib/IDS/tmp to 777.
The folder assets/lib/phpids and the subfolder is secured with a .htaccess file, that denies all possible access from the web. If you use a Microsoft Windows OS with IIS, you should secure the folder with IIS properties, because IIS does not understand .htaccess files.

Open the file assets/modules/phpids/module.phpids.inc.php.tpl and copy the content.
Go to your MODx backend, click on the tab "Modules" -> "Manage Modules" -> New Module".
Name the module PHPIDS and paste the copied code into "Module code (php)".
Now click on "Configuration", there you hav to enable parameter sharing and paste the following line into "Module configuration" and click "Update parameter display".

&useMODxBasePath=Use MODx base path?;list;true,false;true &basePath=PHPIDS path?;string;assets/lib/phpids/lib &useLogFile=Use log file?;list;true,false;false &useEmail=Use email?;list;true,false;true &useDatabase=Use database?;list;true,false;true &useMODxTablePrefix=Use MODx table prefix?;list;true,false;true &useMODxLog=Use MODx Log?;list;true,false;true &logFromImpact=Start logging from impact?;int;5 &sendMailFromImpact=Start sending mails from impact, high (around 15) or very high (around 25-50) impact?;int;15 &idsRecipients=Mail resipients (separated by comma);text; &idsSubject=Mail subject <br />(keep empty to use default);text; &SMTPServer=SMPT server;text; &SMTPPort=SMPT port <br />(default is 25, leave empty to use default);text; &SMTPAccount=SMPT account;text; &SMTPPassword=SMPT password;text; &mailFrom=E-Mail From Name<br> Only used with SMTP;text;PHPIDS;&useExeptions=Exceptions separated with pipes (|);text;&blockedDocumentID=ID of the MODx document, that blocked IPs would see, default is root;text&defaultTableEntries=Default table entries on start;text;20 &redirectIntrusionLevel=Redirect intrusions from a level (50 is hight);text;50 &redirectIntrusionID=Redircet intrusion to the document ID (0 means no redirection);text;0

Now you can change the configuration of the plugin and the module. All parameters, that are not personally as the e-mail address, where the impacts should be reported, are filled with default values.

Click on "Save" and the first module step is done.

Open the file assets/plugins/phpids/plugin.phpids.inc.php.tpl and copy the content.
In your MODx backend click on "Elements" -> "Manage Elements" -> "Plugins" -> "New Plugin".
Name the plugin PHPIDS and paste the copied content into "Plugin code (php)". Then go to "System Events" and under "Template Service Events" choose "OnWebPageInit", then click on save.

Go back the module by "Modules" -> "Manage Modules" -> "PHPIDS" and then on the tab "Dependencies". No click "Manage Dependencies" and there on "Add Plugin".
Here you only have to click on "Insert" and then on "Close".

No go back to "Elements" -> "Manage Elements" -> "Plugins" and edit "PHPIDS". Open tab "Configuration" and choose "PHPIDS" in the drop down box "Import Module shared parameters".

You've done it, the installation is finished.
