    <h1><a name="Using PHPIDS"><span /></a>Using PHPIDS</h1>
    <p>
      To see possible attacks, that are logged to the database, click on 
      "Modules" &#8658; "PHPIDS". This does only work, if you have configured the 
      module with <code>Use database? = True</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two tab-sheets, one shows the list of possible attacks, and the 
      other one shows a list of blocked IP addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table are both completely sortable by clicking on the header of a 
      column.
    <p>
    <h2><a name="The Log Data tab"><span /></a>The Log Data tab</h2>
    <p>
      The Log Data tab shows you possible impacts:

    </p>
    <p>
      The IP address of the attacker is a link, that shows further information 
      in the RIPE database.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to block an attacker by his IP address, you have to click on 
      the button "Block IP". After you've confirmed, that you want to block the 
      shown IP Address, all users with this IP address are forwarded as defined 
      in Redirect intrusion to the document ID (0 means no redirection). For 
      example use a static HTML page, where an attacker can do no harm to your 
      server.
    </p>
    <p>
      <image style="height: 642px; width: 1112px;" alt="Module: Block IP addresses" src="http://phpids-for-modx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/evolution/docs/images/instruction-examples/instruction-using-module-2.jpg" />    
    </p>
    <h2><a name="The Blocked Data tab"><span /></a>The Blocked Data tab</h2>
    <p>
      On the Blocked Data tab you see the currently blocked IP addresses, 
      that are redirected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <image style="height: 180px; width: 580px;" alt="Module: Blocked IP addresses" src="http://phpids-for-modx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/evolution/docs/images/instruction-examples/instruction-using-module-3.jpg" />    
    </p>
    <p>
      The IP address of the attacker is a link, that shows further information 
      in the RIPE database.
    </p>
    <p>
      To unblock a blocked IP Address, just click on the button "Unblock IP" and 
      confirm the dialog:

    </p>
    <h2><a name="The Extended Options tab"><span /></a>The Extended Options tab</h2>
    <p>
      This checks, whether there is a filter update available at phpids.org, or 
      not. Currently there are three possible messages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is no filter update available.</li>
      <li>There is a filter update from {update file date} available</li>
      <li>PHPIDS Filter URI is not available.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      No filter update available means, that everything is OK. If there is a 
      filter update available, then there are two possible options:
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have full rights on the filter file, located in the root directory 
      of your PHPIDS lib folder, then you only have to push the button "Update 
      Filter". Than the new filter data will be read from phpids.org and written 
      to your filter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second option is to download the filter from phpids.org and upload it 
      manually to your system.
    </p>
    <p>
      "PHPIDS Filter URI is not available" means, that the module can't connect 
      to the filter. This may be for example, that there is a problem at 
      phpids.org.
    </p>
    <h3><a name"Download the intrusion data as CSV file"><span /></a>Download the intrusion data as CSV file</h3>
    <p>
      With the link "Download intrusions as CSC" file, you get the complete data 
      of the intrusion table. The delimiter and the enclosure for the CSV files 
      are configurable at the module configuration.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="Empty log table"><span /></a>Empty log table</h3>
    <p>
      It is now possible, to empty the log table, but afterward all entries 
      about previous possible attacks are lost.
    </p>
